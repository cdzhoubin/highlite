            <h1>Melania Trump: Donald's women accusers are lying</h1>
            <img alt="Melania Trump" src="http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/660/cpsprodpb/C676/production/_91960805_hi035859160.jpg" width="356" height="200">
            <p>Melania Trump has insisted that her husband is a "gentleman" and that the women who allege that he sexually assaulted them are lying.</p>
            <p>She also said that lewd comments Donald Trump made about women that were caught on videotape were unacceptable but did not represent the man she knows.</p>
            <p>The Republican presidential nominee was guilty of "boy talk" but was "egged on" by TV host Billy Bush, she added.</p>
            <p>The tape prompted dozens of Republicans to drop their support for him.</p>
            <p>In the video, Mr Trump tells Mr Bush, who was then host of NBC's Access Hollywood, that he can force himself on women because he's a star.</p>
